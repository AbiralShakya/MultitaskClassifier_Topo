# EXTREME BOOST - Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **BatchNorm Error**: Fixed the "Expected more than 1 value per channel when training" error by:
   - Replacing BatchNorm1d with LayerNorm in the classifier network
   - Adding drop_last=True to all training DataLoaders
   - Adding safety checks for small batch sizes

2. **Training Stability**: Improved training stability by:
   - Reducing model complexity to prevent overfitting
   - Adding error handling in training and validation loops
   - Implementing safety checks for mixup augmentation
   - Increasing batch size from 16 to 32

3. **Model Architecture**: Balanced the model architecture by:
   - Reducing encoder dimensions from 512 to 384
   - Reducing number of layers from 6 to 4
   - Reducing number of attention heads
   - Creating a more balanced fusion network

4. **Optimization Strategy**: Improved optimization strategy by:
   - Reducing learning rate from 1e-4 to 5e-5
   - Increasing weight decay from 1e-4 to 2e-4
   - Extending warmup period from 5 to 10 epochs
   - Reducing maximum learning rate from 2e-4 to 1e-4

## Key Changes

1. **Model Architecture**:
   - More balanced encoder dimensions (384 instead of 512)
   - Fewer layers (4 instead of 6) to reduce overfitting
   - Fewer attention heads (6 instead of 8/16) for better stability

2. **Training Process**:
   - Increased batch size to 32 for better stability
   - Added drop_last=True to avoid single-sample batches
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Improved mixup augmentation with safety checks

3. **Optimization**:
   - Lower learning rate (5e-5) for better stability
   - Higher weight decay (2e-4) to prevent overfitting
   - Longer warmup period (10 epochs) for better initialization
   - Lower maximum learning rate (1e-4) to prevent divergence

These changes should significantly improve training stability and performance, allowing the model to achieve better accuracy without encountering the BatchNorm error.
