- **Data Utilization**: Better train/val split ratios
- **Advanced Techniques**: Mixup, test-time augmentation, ensemble methods

## 🚀 **Ultimate Enhancements Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Architecture (More Capacity)**
```python
# Before: 256D encoders
crystal_encoder = TopologicalCrystalEncoder(hidden_dim=256, num_layers=4)
kspace_encoder = KSpaceTransformerGNNEncoder(hidden_dim=256, n_layers=4)

# After: 384D encoders with deeper networks
crystal_encoder = TopologicalCrystalEncoder(hidden_dim=384, num_layers=6)
kspace_encoder = KSpaceTransformerGNNEncoder(hidden_dim=384, n_layers=6, num_heads=12)
```

### **2. Multi-Layer Attention Fusion**
```python
# Before: Single attention layer
attention = MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=1024, num_heads=8)

# After: Dual attention + feature mixing
attention1 = MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=1536, num_heads=16)
attention2 = MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=1536, num_heads=16)
feature_mixer = Sequential(Linear, LayerNorm, GELU, Dropout, Linear)
```

### **3. Advanced Loss Function**
```python
# Enhanced focal loss with multiple components
focal_loss = (1 - pt)^2.5 * ce_loss  # Stronger focusing
diversity_loss = -log(std(features))  # Feature diversity
confidence_loss = -log(max_probs)     # Confident predictions

total_loss = focal_loss + 0.1*diversity_loss + 0.05*confidence_loss
```

### **4. Data Augmentation (Mixup)**
```python
# Mixup at feature level
mixed_features = λ * features_a + (1-λ) * features_b
mixed_loss = λ * loss_a + (1-λ) * loss_b
```

### **5. Test-Time Augmentation**
```python
# Multiple forward passes during validation
outputs_list = []
for _ in range(3):
    outputs = model(batch)
    outputs_list.append(outputs['logits'])
avg_logits = torch.stack(outputs_list).mean(dim=0)
```

### **6. Optimized Training Strategy**
```python
# Better data splits (more training data)
train_size = 85% (was 80%)
val_size = 12.75% (was 16%)
test_size = 15% (was 20%)

# Enhanced scheduler with restarts
scheduler = CosineWarmupScheduler(
    warmup_epochs=8,
    max_epochs=80,
    restart_epochs=[30, 50]  # Learning rate restarts
)

# Optimal batch size and stronger regularization
batch_size = 24  # Sweet spot for this dataset
weight_decay = 2e-4  # Stronger regularization
```

## 📊 **Expected Performance Boost**

### **Baseline (Your Current Results):**
```
Test Accuracy: 86.64%
Test F1 Score: 86.26%
Gap to Target: -5.36%
```

### **Ultimate Model (Expected):**
