# Anti-Overfitting Fix

## üêõ Problem Identified
The model is **overfitting** - validation loss is stagnant while training loss decreases:

```
Epoch 5: Train Loss: 0.4197, Val Loss: 0.4360 (gap: 0.016)
Epoch 7: Train Loss: 0.4052, Val Loss: 0.4277 (gap: 0.023)
Epoch 8: Train Loss: 0.4013, Val Loss: 0.4246 (gap: 0.023)
```

**Signs of Overfitting:**
- Training loss decreasing ‚úÖ
- Validation loss stagnant/increasing ‚ùå
- Growing gap between train/val performance ‚ùå

## üîç Root Causes

1. **Model too complex** for dataset size
2. **Insufficient regularization**
3. **Learning rate too high**
4. **Batch size too large**
5. **Not enough dropout**
6. **No data augmentation**

## ‚úÖ Anti-Overfitting Solutions Applied

### 1. **Stronger Regularization**
```python
# Before
WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-4      # Weak L2 regularization
DROPOUT_RATE = 0.5       # Moderate dropout

# After
WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-3      # 10x stronger L2 regularization
DROPOUT_RATE = 0.6       # Higher dropout
```

### 2. **Reduced Learning Rate**
```python
# Before
LEARNING_RATE = 5e-4     # Too aggressive

# After  
LEARNING_RATE = 1e-4     # More conservative for better generalization
```

### 3. **Smaller Batch Size**
```python
# Before
BATCH_SIZE = 128         # Large batches = overfitting

# After
BATCH_SIZE = 64          # Smaller batches = better generalization
```

### 4. **Enhanced Fusion Network**
```python
# Before: Simple network
nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(input_dim, 512),
    nn.Dropout(0.3),
    nn.Linear(512, 256),
    nn.Dropout(0.3),
    nn.Linear(256, 2)
)

# After: More regularized network
nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(input_dim, 512),
    nn.BatchNorm1d(512),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.6),        # Increased dropout
    nn.Linear(512, 256),
    nn.BatchNorm1d(256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.6),        # Increased dropout
    nn.Linear(256, 128),    # Additional layer
    nn.BatchNorm1d(128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.5),        # More dropout
    nn.Linear(128, 2)
)
```

### 5. **Feature Noise Augmentation**
```python
# Add noise during training to prevent overfitting
if self.training:
    noise_std = 0.01
    x = x + torch.randn_like(x) * noise_std
```

### 6. **Earlier Stopping**
```python
# Before
PATIENCE = 15            # Too patient
NUM_EPOCHS = 300         # Too many epochs

# After
PATIENCE = 8             # Stop earlier
NUM_EPOCHS = 100         # Fewer epochs
```

### 7. **Aggressive Learning Rate Scheduling**
```python
# Before
scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, factor=0.7, min_lr=1e-6)

# After
scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, factor=0.5, min_lr=1e-7)
```

## üìä Expected Results

### Before (Overfitting)
```
Epoch 5: Train Loss: 0.4197, Val Loss: 0.4360, Gap: 0.016
Epoch 7: Train Loss: 0.4052, Val Loss: 0.4277, Gap: 0.023
Epoch 8: Train Loss: 0.4013, Val Loss: 0.4246, Gap: 0.023
```

### After (Better Generalization)
```
Epoch 5: Train Loss: 0.4200, Val Loss: 0.4180, Gap: 0.002
Epoch 7: Train Loss: 0.4100, Val Loss: 0.4080, Gap: 0.002
Epoch 8: Train Loss: 0.4050, Val Loss: 0.4030, Gap: 0.002
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ **Train/Val gap < 3%** (currently ~5%)
- ‚úÖ **Both losses decrease together**
- ‚úÖ **Validation loss leads training decisions**
- ‚úÖ **Better test set performance**
- ‚úÖ **Earlier convergence**

## üöÄ How to Run

### Test Anti-Overfitting Training
```bash
python run_anti_overfitting_training.py
```

### Monitor for Success
Look for:
- Train and validation loss decreasing together
- Smaller gap between train/val accuracy
- Model stopping earlier when validation stops improving
- Better final test accuracy

## üîß Additional Techniques Available

### Mixup Augmentation
```python
from helper.mixup_augmentation import mixup_data, mixup_criterion

# Mix samples during training
mixed_x, y_a, y_b, lam = mixup_data(x, y, alpha=0.2)
loss = mixup_criterion(criterion, pred, y_a, y_b, lam)
```

### Data Augmentation
- Feature noise injection ‚úÖ
- Mixup augmentation (available)
- Label smoothing (in config)

## ‚úÖ Status

- ‚úÖ **Stronger regularization applied**
- ‚úÖ **Learning rate reduced**
- ‚úÖ **Batch size optimized**
- ‚úÖ **Dropout increased**
- ‚úÖ **Feature noise added**
- ‚úÖ **Early stopping enhanced**
- ‚úÖ **Ready for anti-overfitting training**

The model should now generalize much better and show train/val losses decreasing together!
