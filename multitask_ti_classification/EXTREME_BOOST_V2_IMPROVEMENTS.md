# EXTREME BOOST V2 - Advanced Improvements

## Overview

Based on the results from the first version of Extreme Boost (88.36% accuracy), we've implemented several advanced techniques to close the remaining 3.6% gap to reach the target of 92% accuracy.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Model Architecture

- **Residual Blocks**: Added residual connections throughout the network for better gradient flow
- **Deep Supervision**: Implemented auxiliary classifiers at different depths for better training signal
- **Stochastic Depth**: Added stochastic depth for improved regularization and ensemble-like behavior
- **Balanced Architecture**: Fine-tuned model dimensions for optimal performance

### 2. Advanced Training Techniques

- **CutMix Augmentation**: Added CutMix in addition to MixUp for better data augmentation
- **Improved Learning Rate Schedule**: Extended warmup period and training duration
- **Lower Learning Rate**: Reduced learning rate from 5e-5 to 3e-5 for better stability
- **Higher Weight Decay**: Increased weight decay from 2e-4 to 3e-4 for better regularization
- **Increased Patience**: Extended early stopping patience from 10 to 15 epochs
- **Increased TTA Samples**: More test-time augmentation samples (10 instead of 5)

### 3. Ensemble Improvements

- **Larger Ensemble**: Increased ensemble size from 3 to 5 models
- **More Diverse Models**: Greater variation in hyperparameters between ensemble members
- **Weighted Voting**: Implemented weighted voting for ensemble prediction

### 4. Training Process Enhancements

- **Reproducibility**: Added seed setting for reproducible results
- **Longer Training**: Extended training duration from 80 to 150 epochs for full model
- **Larger Batch Size**: Maintained batch size of 32 for better stability
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling in training and validation loops

## Expected Improvements

These enhancements are designed to push the model performance beyond the current 88.36% accuracy:

1. **Residual connections** should help with training deeper networks
2. **Deep supervision** should improve gradient flow and feature learning
3. **Advanced augmentation** should reduce overfitting and improve generalization
4. **Larger ensemble** with more diverse models should capture more patterns
5. **Extended training** with better scheduling should allow the model to converge to better solutions

The combination of these techniques aims to close the remaining 3.6% gap to reach the target 92% accuracy.
