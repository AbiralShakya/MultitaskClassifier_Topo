# 🎯 Optimized Architecture for 92%+ Accuracy

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Key Design Principles:**
1. **Balanced Capacity**: Not too simple (can't learn) or too complex (overfits)
2. **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Proper integration of all data modalities
3. **Advanced Regularization**: Smart techniques that don't kill learning
4. **Robust Training**: Techniques that ensure stable, high performance

## 🧠 **Model Architecture**

### **1. Multi-Modal Encoders**
```python
# Crystal Structure (GNN with Residuals)
crystal_conv1: GCNConv(3 → 64)
crystal_conv2: GCNConv(64 → 128) 
crystal_conv3: GCNConv(128 → 128) + residual
→ Global pooling (mean + max) → 256 features

# K-Space (GNN with Residuals)  
kspace_conv1: GCNConv(64 → 128)
kspace_conv2: GCNConv(128 → 256)
kspace_conv3: GCNConv(256 → 256) + residual
→ Global pooling (mean + max) → 512 features

# Scalar Features (MLP)
scalar_encoder: 10 → 64 → 128 features

# Decomposition Features (MLP)
decomp_encoder: 64 → 128 → 256 features
```

### **2. Feature Fusion with Self-Attention**
```python
# Concatenate all modalities
total_features = 256 + 512 + 128 + 256 = 1152

# Self-attention for cross-modal interactions
attention = MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=1152, num_heads=8)
attended_features = attention(features, features, features)

# Residual connection
final_features = attended_features + original_features
```

### **3. Classification Head**
```python
classifier = Sequential(
    Linear(1152 → 256),
    BatchNorm1d(256),
    ReLU(),
    Dropout(0.3),
    
    Linear(256 → 128),
    BatchNorm1d(128), 
    ReLU(),
    Dropout(0.3),
    
    Linear(128 → 2)  # Binary classification
)
```

## 🔧 **Advanced Training Techniques**

### **1. Focal Loss**
```python
# Handles class imbalance better than standard cross-entropy
ce_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, targets, reduction='none')
pt = torch.exp(-ce_loss)
focal_loss = (1 - pt)^2 * ce_loss
```

### **2. Feature Diversity Regularization**
```python
# Encourages different features to capture different patterns
feature_std = torch.std(features, dim=0).mean()
diversity_loss = -torch.log(feature_std + 1e-8)
total_loss = focal_loss + 0.1 * diversity_loss
```

### **3. Cosine Warmup Scheduler**
```python
# 5 epochs warmup + cosine annealing
if epoch < 5:
    lr = base_lr * (epoch + 1) / 5  # Linear warmup
else:
    lr = eta_min + (base_lr - eta_min) * 0.5 * (1 + cos(π * progress))
```

### **4. Smart Early Stopping**
```python
# Patience=10, min_delta=0.001, restore best weights
if val_loss < best_loss - 0.001:
    best_loss = val_loss
    counter = 0
    save_best_weights()
else:
    counter += 1
    if counter >= 10:
        restore_best_weights()
        stop_training()
```

## 📊 **Optimized Hyperparameters**

### **Training Configuration**
```python
LEARNING_RATE = 2e-4      # Balanced (not too fast/slow)
WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-4       # Moderate L2 regularization  
BATCH_SIZE = 64           # Standard size
DROPOUT_RATE = 0.3        # Moderate dropout
PATIENCE = 10             # Patient early stopping
WARMUP_EPOCHS = 5         # Learning rate warmup
MAX_EPOCHS = 50           # Sufficient training time
GRAD_CLIP = 1.0          # Gradient clipping
```

### **Optimizer**
```python
AdamW(
    lr=2e-4,
    weight_decay=1e-4,
    betas=(0.9, 0.999),
    eps=1e-8
)
```
