# Integrated Checkpoint Training Usage

## ðŸš€ **How to Use with Your Existing SLURM Script**

The checkpoint functionality is now **integrated into your main training script** (`classifier_training.py`), so it works seamlessly with your existing SLURM setup!

### **No Changes Needed to Your SLURM Script**

Your existing `submit_training.sh` script will work exactly the same:

```bash
# Your existing SLURM script still works
sbatch submit_training.sh
```

### **What Happens Automatically**

1. **First Run**: Training starts fresh, saves checkpoints every 5 epochs
2. **After Crash**: When you restart, it automatically detects and resumes from the latest checkpoint
3. **No Manual Intervention**: Everything happens automatically

### **Checkpoint Files Created**

```
./checkpoints/
â”œâ”€â”€ checkpoint_epoch_5.pt      # Full training state
â”œâ”€â”€ checkpoint_epoch_10.pt     # Full training state  
â”œâ”€â”€ indices_epoch_5.pkl        # Dataset splits
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### **Example Workflow**

#### **First Run (Fresh Start)**
```bash
sbatch submit_training.sh
```
Output:
```
Starting main training loop...
Using device: cuda:0
No checkpoint found. Starting fresh training...
Loading dataset with preloading...
Starting epoch 1/100
...
Checkpoint saved: ./checkpoints/checkpoint_epoch_5.pt
...
```

#### **After a Crash (Automatic Resume)**
```bash
sbatch submit_training.sh
```
Output:
```
Starting main training loop...
Using device: cuda:0
Found existing checkpoint: ./checkpoints/checkpoint_epoch_10.pt
Resuming from checkpoint...
Checkpoint loaded from epoch 10 with best val loss: 0.2345
Resuming from epoch 11
Starting epoch 11/100
...
```

### **Key Benefits**

- **ðŸ”„ Automatic**: No manual intervention needed
- **ðŸ’¾ Crash Recovery**: Automatically resumes from latest checkpoint
- **âš¡ GPU Accelerated**: Works with the new GPU spectral encoder
- **ðŸ§  Memory Management**: Better memory handling to prevent crashes
- **ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking**: Saves all training metrics

### **Perfect for Your Use Case**

Since you've been experiencing:
- **Segmentation faults** at epoch 10
- **4-5 hour epochs** (expensive to lose)
- **SLURM job timeouts**

The integrated checkpoint system is **perfect** because:
1. **Saves every 5 epochs** (before your typical crash at epoch 10)
2. **Works with existing SLURM script** (no changes needed)
3. **Automatic recovery** from crashes
4. **Better memory management** to prevent crashes

### **What's Different Now**

- **Before**: Lost all progress when training crashed
- **After**: Automatically resumes from the last checkpoint
- **Before**: Had to manually restart from scratch
- **After**: Just restart the same SLURM job

### **Expected Behavior**

1. **Start training**: `sbatch submit_training.sh`
2. **Let it run**: Saves checkpoints every 5 epochs
3. **If it crashes**: Restart with `sbatch submit_training.sh`
4. **Automatic resume**: Picks up exactly where it left off

**No more lost training progress!** ðŸŽ¯

The checkpoint system is now fully integrated and will work automatically with your existing SLURM setup.
